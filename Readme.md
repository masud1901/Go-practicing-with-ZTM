# Go Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice code and exercises from the Zero To Mastery (ZTM) Go course. It serves as a learning journal while I improve my Go programming skills.

## About This Repository

This is a personal learning project where I practice Go programming concepts covered in the ZTM Go course. Each folder corresponds to different sections or concepts from the course.

## Course Structure

The repository is organized according to the main topics covered in the ZTM Go course:

- **Basics**: Variables, data types, control structures, and functions
- **Intermediate**: Structs, interfaces, error handling, and packages
- **Advanced**: Concurrency, goroutines, channels, and testing
- **Projects**: Mini projects and applications built during the course

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine (at least version 1.18)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/masud1901/go-practice-ztm.git
cd go-practice-ztm
```
